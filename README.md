Technical Components




Web Scraping




Description:
The web scraping module uses Cheerio, a fast and flexible tool for Node.js, to extract relevant information from company websites. Key sections targeted include About Us, Careers, and News.




Purpose:
To gather detailed and up-to-date information about target companies, which forms the basis for subsequent analysis and insights.




Implementation:




const axios = require('axios');
const cheerio = require('cheerio');




const scrapeCompanyWebsite = async (url) => {
Â  try {
Â  Â  const { data } = await axios.get(url);
Â  Â  const $ = cheerio.load(data);




Â  Â  const aboutUs = $('#about-us').text();
Â  Â  const careers = $('#careers').text();
Â  Â  const news = $('#news').text();




Â  Â  return {
Â  Â  Â  aboutUs,
Â  Â  Â  careers,
Â  Â  Â  news
Â  Â  };
Â  } catch (error) {
Â  Â  console.error(`Error scraping website: ${error}`);
Â  Â  return {};
Â  }
};




module.exports = {
Â  scrapeCompanyWebsite
};




API Integration




Description:
API integration aggregates essential data such as financial metrics, news updates, and social media activity from various sources. This data provides a comprehensive view of the target companyâ€™s current status.




Purpose:
To enrich the analysis with real-time and historical data, ensuring sales professionals have a complete picture of their prospects.




Implementation:




const axios = require('axios');




const fetchStockData = async (ticker) => {
Â  const url = `https://api.example.com/stock/${ticker}`;
Â  const response = await axios.get(url);
Â  return response.json();
};




module.exports = {
Â  fetchStockData
};




OpenAI Foundation Model




Description:
The AI Sales Assistant uses OpenAIâ€™s language model to generate detailed reports and analyses based on the collected data. This model helps in understanding the current state of the target company, identifying pain points, and suggesting actionable insights.




Purpose:
To provide in-depth, AI-generated analysis that aligns with sales methodologies like Value Selling and MEDDICC, aiding sales professionals in crafting their pitch and strategy.




Implementation:




const { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require('openai');
require('dotenv').config();




const configuration = new Configuration({
Â  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});




const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);




const generateAnalysis = async (text) => {
Â  try {
Â  Â  const response = await openai.createCompletion({
Â  Â  Â  model: 'text-davinci-003',
Â  Â  Â  prompt: `Analyze the following text and provide a detailed report:\n\n${text}`,
Â  Â  Â  max_tokens: 500,
Â  Â  });




Â  Â  return response.data.choices[0].text.trim();
Â  } catch (error) {
Â  Â  console.error(`Error generating analysis: ${error}`);
Â  Â  return 'Error generating analysis';
Â  }
};




module.exports = {
Â  generateAnalysis
};




Comprehensive Reporting




Description:
The reporting component compiles the gathered and analyzed data into detailed, structured reports. These reports are designed to align with established sales methodologies and provide actionable recommendations.




Purpose:
To present sales professionals with clear, concise, and actionable insights that they can use to engage prospects effectively.




Implementation:




const { Document } = require('docx');




const generateReport = (data) => {
Â  const doc = new Document();
Â  doc.addSection({
Â  Â  children: [
Â  Â  Â  new Paragraph({
Â  Â  Â  Â  text: 'Company Analysis Report',
Â  Â  Â  Â  heading: HeadingLevel.HEADING_1,
Â  Â  Â  }),
Â  Â  Â  new Paragraph({
Â  Â  Â  Â  text: `Company Name: ${data.name}`,
Â  Â  Â  }),
Â  Â  Â  new Paragraph({
Â  Â  Â  Â  text: `Industry: ${data.industry}`,
Â  Â  Â  }),
Â  Â  Â  new Paragraph({
Â  Â  Â  Â  text: `Stock Price: ${data.stockPrice}`,
Â  Â  Â  }),
Â  Â  Â  // Add more sections as needed

Â  });




Â  return doc;
};




module.exports = {
